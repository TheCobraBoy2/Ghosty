# Welcome to Ghosty
Ghosty is an extremely powerful and lightweight Roblox game framework.

## Why Ghosty?
While other game frameworks exist (most notably AGF & Knit), Ghosty provides a different feature set as well as a different focus. Ghosty was created around the idea that organization comes before everything else. Many games tend to quickly become disorganized as they get populated with more and more scripts. Ghosty solves this problem through executables, module scripts Ghosty can read and assign to the server and client for simple communication between them. Ghosty also makes giving users the ability to manipulate the control flow of their scripts a priority including in an asynchronous manner.
